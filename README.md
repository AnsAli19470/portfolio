### **Project 3: Cats and Dogs Classification Using Transfer Learning**  
- Developed an **image classification model** to distinguish between **cats and dogs** using **transfer learning** with pre-trained deep learning models.  
- Utilized architectures like **VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNet** to extract high-level features from images, significantly reducing training time while improving accuracy.  
- Preprocessed the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying **data augmentation** (rotation, flipping, and zooming) to enhance generalization.  
- Achieved **98% accuracy** on the Kaggle **Cats vs. Dogs dataset**, outperforming traditional CNN models trained from scratch.  
- Fine-tuned the last few layers of the pre-trained models to adapt them to the specific task while using **early stopping and learning rate scheduling** to prevent overfitting.  
- Deployed the model as a **real-time web app** using **Flask and TensorFlow Serving**, allowing users to upload an image and receive instant classification results.  
- Optimized the model for **mobile and edge devices** using **TensorFlow Lite**, enabling lightweight and efficient deployment.

### **Project 4: Movie Recommendation System**  
- Developed a **personalized movie recommendation system** using **collaborative filtering and content-based filtering** techniques.
